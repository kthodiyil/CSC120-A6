- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I really like using inheritance in coding because it makes it a lot easier to code between classes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I would say that referring to the class coding examples to understand the specific inheritance syntax is really useful. Also, the slideshows are always a great resource so refer back to those too.
    Additionally, I love the oracle doc and it is so useful for finding built in methods to use.
